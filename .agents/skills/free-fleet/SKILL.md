name: free-fleet
description: Run repeatable bulk classification, extraction, summarization, and triage across free and local LLM workers with closed fields, exact quote offsets, SQLite checkpoints, bounded attempts, and explicit route-price evidence. Use when every returned claim must be typed and traceable to its source; do not use for open-ended agent delegation.

# Free Fleet

Deliver a validated `free_fleet_v2` packet from typed input while SQLite retains the exact task revision, queue state, attempts, verified results, routes, and receipts.

Start with `command -v free-fleet`. On a fresh system, run `free-fleet setup --workspace-root "$PWD" --refresh-routes --json`, then execute its typed `next_commands` in order.

## Choose the operation

- To define or change extraction fields, read [references/task-contracts.md](references/task-contracts.md).
- To test, run, resume, monitor status, evaluate routes, export, inspect routes, or configure MCP, read [references/operations.md](references/operations.md).
- For tabular data, use CSV input (`--id-column`, `--text-column`) and export (`--format csv|jsonl`). HTML, PDF, TXT, and MD are also accepted as single-item inputs.
- For status queries, run `free-fleet status <run_id>` or use MCP `free_fleet_status`; do not resume or start runs for monitoring.
- To benchmark routes against task samples before large runs, use `free-fleet eval TASK --input FILE --concurrency 4` or MCP `free_fleet_eval`.
- For a zero-key proof in 30s, run `free-fleet quickstart --demo` (deterministic `demo/fake` provider, no API keys).
- For schema bootstrapping from labels, use `free-fleet init NAME --from-example labels.csv [--label-column label]`.

## Invariants

1. SQLite is the system of record. JSON, JSONL, and CSV are typed import/export formats.
2. Use registered task names. Import declarative `TaskSpec` JSON only when a file is explicitly supplied; never load Python task plugins.
3. Require `claims_schema.type: object` and `additionalProperties: false`.
4. Treat model output as untrusted until candidate-output, claims-schema, deterministic quote normalization, and canonical `ModelOutput` checks pass.
5. The model may omit quote offsets only when its exact quote text occurs once in the named slice. Repeated text requires explicit offsets.
6. A route name containing `free` proves nothing. Zero-price runs use only `price_observed_zero` routes. Local endpoints (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`) default to zero cost; external OpenAI-compatible endpoints require explicit pricing or are treated as unknown cost.
7. OpenCode runs through the normally installed CLI. Its task-local configuration denies model tool permissions, defines no task MCP servers, and disables sharing. Keep that single transport boundary.
8. For MCP, set one absolute `--workspace-root`. Keep its SQLite database and every file path below that root.
9. Read exported packets through `read_packet`; it checks the embedded TaskSpec digest and revalidates every record's claims. Do not bypass `free_fleet_v2` validation.
10. Model selection uses Bayesian-smoothed historical scoring. Every intermediate attempt failure, schema error, ungrounded quote, rate limit, and latency is recorded immutably in `inference_attempts`.
11. Mechanical discovery enforces a 70% source-capture floor by default. Its report includes per-backend hit/capture counts, and fetched records retain the backend, query, and originating URL.

## Workflow

1. Run `free-fleet doctor --json`, then inspect `free-fleet routes --json`. Refresh only when requested or needed; refresh contacts providers and appends route evidence.
2. For a zero-key proof, run `free-fleet quickstart --demo --run-id demo --json` (writes `runs/demo/clean_packet.json` + `.csv` via `demo/fake`).
3. For local or private models (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio), add the route with `free-fleet routes add <id> --provider <provider> --free`.
4. Create or select a task (`--preset score|filter|classify|extract|triage|summarize` or `--from-example labels.csv`), then run `free-fleet validate TASK --input FILE [--only-ids FILE] --json` before inference. Long documents are sliding-window sliced (lossless overlapping windows, sentence-snapped, `partial:true`) with exact offsets; `validate` warns when truncation occurs.
5. Run one batch with `free-fleet test TASK --input FILE --json`.
6. Optionally benchmark candidate routes with `free-fleet eval TASK --input FILE --concurrency 4 --json` to update Bayesian ranking priors (now parallelized per-sample/per-route).
7. Start the bounded campaign with an explicit run ID, session count, attempt ceiling, and optional policy (`--free-only` for verified zero-cost, `--zdr`, `--provider`, `--exclude-provider`, `--max-request-cost`, `--only-ids` for multi-stage compounding filters).
8. Monitor progress in real time with `free-fleet status RUN_ID --watch` or machine-readable `free-fleet status RUN_ID --json` (stream-friendly).
9. On interruption, inspect the stored run and call `free-fleet resume RUN_ID`; do not reconstruct or restart its batches from input files.
10. Export and validate the packet with `free-fleet export RUN_ID [--format json|csv|jsonl] [--sort-by CLAIM] [--desc] [--top N] [--rank] [--filter CLAIMFILTER_JSON]`. Use `free-fleet db backup <path>` for safe SQLite copies. Report database path, run ID, packet path, verified/failed counts, attempts, and route/cost evidence.

Never call a worker session an independent coding-agent session. `--sessions` is bounded batch concurrency inside one free-fleet campaign.
